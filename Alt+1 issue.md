# Alt+1 issue in GNU/Linux (KDE Plasma)

There is a shortcut in System Setting/Shortcuts/Global Shortcuts for **Walk Through Windows of Current Application (Reverse)** and **Walk Through Windows of Current Application**, which is set to `alt+~`, if you delete that shortcut (i.e. set it to custom and leave it empty, then press `apply`) you will be able to use `alt+1` in other applications, like you case with the browser (tested under different Linux distro with KDE Plasma).

On my keyboard layout `~` is on key `1`, maybe that is why it worked for me.

Although you have to disable **Walk through windows of current application** which was the back tick: `` Alt+` ``.

Now the problem is solved and you can easily change between tabs (in editor, browser and etc.).
